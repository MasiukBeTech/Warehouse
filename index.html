        <p> <strong>  Winston Churchill</strong>, in full Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill,<br>
             <em>(born November 30, 1874, Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, England—died January 24, 1965, London)</em>,<br>
              British statesman, orator, and author who as prime minister (1940–45, 1951–55) rallied the British<br>
               people during World War II and led his country from the brink of defeat to victory.</p>
        <p>After a sensational rise to prominence in national politics before <u>World War I</u>, <br>
             Churchill acquired a reputation for erratic judgment in the war itself and in the decade that followed.<br>
              Politically suspect in consequence, he was a lonely figure until his response to Adolf Hitler’s <br>
              challenge brought him to leadership of a national coalition in 1940. With Franklin D. Roosevelt <br>
              and Joseph Stalin he then shaped Allied strategy in World War II, and after the breakdown of the alliance<br>
               he alerted the West to the expansionist threat of the Soviet Union. He led the Conservative Party <br>
               back to office in 1951 and remained prime minister until 1955, when ill health forced his resignation.</p>
